have been introduced for mapping networks of gene and protein interactions, including 
yeast-two-hybrid assays, affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry, chromatin 
immunoprecipitation measurements, synthetic-lethal and suppressor networks, 
expression QTLs, and many others. These technologies have the potential to revolutionize 
the study of human health, by enabling the construction of large pathway maps which 
can pinpoint the molecular mechanisms underlying normal and disease states of biological 
systems. However, the enormous variety and number of new molecular interaction 
measurements necessitate new algorithms, conceptual frameworks, and software to 
integrate, query, visualize, and interpret the resulting network data. The aim of the 
National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) is to provide a freely available, open-source 
suite of software technology that broadly enables network-based visualization, analysis, 
and biomedical discovery for NIH-funded researchers. Our overall objectives are to 
assemble large-scale biological data into models of networks and pathways and to use 
these networks to better understand how biological systems operate under normal 
conditions ahd how they fail in disease. These goals will be carried out in four Technology 
Research and Development projects: A. Network-based biomarkers for disease 
classification; B. Recognizing trend motifs and dynamics in social networks; C. Network 
visualization and representation; and D. Predictive modeling and network inference. The 
centerpiece of our software development and support efforts will be Cytoscape, currently 
one of the most functional and widely used network visualization and analysis tools. Now 
in its sixth year of development, Cytoscape is co-developed by a multi-disciplinary team of 
institutions known as the Cytoscape Consortium, who also comprise the host institutions 
of our proposed resource.</Abstract><Type>S</Type><Progress></Progress><Investigator><Person_ID>453037</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>P</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>548479</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>548480</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>548478</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>548476</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>548477</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>548481</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Percent_Grant_Dollars>100</Percent_Grant_Dollars></Subproject><Subproject Sub_ID="305076"><Subproject_ID>0002</Subproject_ID><Title>NETWORK-GUIDED FORESTS (NGF) IDENTIFY NETWORK 
MODULES AS [TRD A]
BIOMARKERS</Title><AIDS_Flag>N</AIDS_Flag><Abstract>Recent progress in high-throughput biological technologies such as yeast two-hybrid 
enabled us to obtain huge amount of interaction data and it is becoming very important to 
identify their functional network structures hidden in such data. In molecular networks, 
such structures underlie signaling and metabolic pathways. Network structures may be 
identified as connected subnetworks of interactions having particular properties, called 
network modules, or as statistically enriched patterns of interaction called network motifs. 
Network modules and motifs are proving to be of fundamental importance for 
understanding the molecular basis of disease and for classifying disease states. Our 
projects have been pursuing technological advances to better reveal network modular 
structure or to apply modules to predict disease outcomes. In particular, we have been 
developing technology to better enable network-based biomarkers based on the concept 
that network modules are better predictors of cell state than are individual genes or 
proteins. 
Many biological and clinical outcomes are based not on single proteins, but on modules of 
proteins embedded in protein networks. Given the importance of protein modules and 
their outputs, a major activity within the field of Systems Biology has been to identify 
such modules systematically through analysis of global data sets [1-5]. However, while a 
number of methods have been proposed to identify coherently expressed or perturbed 
modules, current methods do not provide the rich logical framework known to occur in 
biological systems.

modules whose logic specifies key biological and clinical outcomes. NGF integrates key 
ideas from Random Forests (RF) [6] with biological constraints induced by a protein-
protein interaction network— the first use of protein networks in ensemble learning. The 
NGF framework learns a set of decision trees (the “forest”) in which each tree maps to a 
connected component of the protein-protein interaction network (Fig. 1). The decision 
tree specifies a function that determines the output of the network component based on 
the activity of its genes. In turn, the collection of all tree outputs is used to predict the cell 
type or disease state of the biological sample (the “class”).
 	By construction, decision trees detect genes that influence a phenotypic outcome 
both individually and through multiway interactions with other genes. As in the standard 
Random Forests algorithm, NGF uses a permutation-based procedure to assess the 
importance of each gene on the classification accuracy of the forest. We also assess the 
importance of pairs of genes in a tree — in our study these pairs are constrained by the 
network neighborhood. Genes and gene pairs with significantly high importance scores are 
placed into clusters that capture similar patterns of presence/absence across the forest of 
decision trees. Each cluster aggregates genes that fall into the same network region and, 
in combination, have predictive power over the sample class. Hence these clusters are 
termed “consensus decision modules” (Fig. 1).
 	We applied NGF to explore the functions used in diverse biological programs related 
to tissue differentiation (Fig. 1), breast cancer metastasis, or mesenchymal 
transformation of brain tumors, identifying sets of network modules which capture known 
causal mechanisms of development or disease. The modules implement diverse logic 
functions using both coherent and opposing gene activities, in which the module output 
depends on expression increases for some genes and concomitant decreases for others. 
Notably, we found that in cancer progression the most predictive decision functions can be 
linked to interactions between known oncogenes and tumor suppressors, such that the 
combined activity of both types of genes determines the disease outcome.

Figure 1. Network-guided search for modules underlying tissue origin. Expression profiles 
of adult tissue samples classified by their developmental origin are combined with a 
network of protein-protein interactions among human transcription factors. Multiple 
decision trees are built to describe the differential activity of many possibly overlapping 
network regions. Network regions are clustered and filtered to identify core modules of 
genes and gene interactions that are important for correct tissue classification. Grey 
interactions within modules indicate gene pairs most often used by the decision trees. 
Gene pairs that are most important for classification (as indicated by the permutation 
test) are shown in blue. Class-specific expression of an important interaction between 
HOXC8-SMAD1 (a known regulatory heterodimer) is shown.

sequence mutations, DNA copy-number alterations, and mRNA expression profiles, in 
order to identify altered sub-networks in cancer. We refer to these modules as “driver 
networks”, as they are likely to contribute to tumorigenesis in multiple patients. With 
NRNB funding, we have recently begun to explore the use of an optimization algorithm 
borrowed from statistical physics to connect altered genes in cancer into minimal spanning 
networks. Such networks can identify the set of interactions able to explain the pattern of 
correlated alterations in cancer, i.e. the driver networks, from a human reference 
interaction network. The algorithm we are using, which addresses the minimum Steiner 
tree problem, attempts to find the shortest connection between altered genes in a specific 
cancer type. This network may be constructed with direct connections between altered 
genes and/or with connections between altered and unaltered genes within a human 
reference interaction network.
 	In general, this problem is classified as an NP-complete problem, meaning that there 
is no efficient way of finding a solution. Additionally, once a network approaches an order 
of magnitude of 10 altered genes, the minimum Steiner tree can only be approximated. 
In order to handle the large number of genes in the human reference network, we are 
using an algorithmic framework based on a distributed method, called message passing. 
This method has been shown to be successful in various applications, such as detecting 
protein associations in cell signaling [10] and data clustering [11]. We are currently 
evaluating the use of the Steiner tree algorithm by using a training dataset from 
glioblastoma and exploring the range of improvement obtained by varying the interaction 
weights between genes in the human reference network based on the mRNA expression 
profiles (Figure 1).

controls for population stratification, the results show that one genotype is positively 
correlated (homophily) and one genotype is negatively correlated (heterophily). A replication 
study on an independent sample from the Framingham Heart Study verifies that DRD2 
exhibits significant homophily and that CYP2A6 exhibits significant heterophily. These novel 
results show that homophily and heterophily obtain on a genetic (indeed, an allelic) level, 
which has implications for the study of population genetics and social behavior. In particular, 
the results suggest that association tests should include friends&apos; genes and that theories of 
evolution should take into account the fact that humans might, in some sense, be 
&quot;metagenomic&quot; with respect to the humans around them. This work continues to build off 
our original DBP for the “Role of Social Networks in the Spread of Disease,” led by Nicholas 
Christakis.

HIERARCHICAL, MODULAR NETWORKS [TRD C]</Title><AIDS_Flag>N</AIDS_Flag><Abstract>Biologists frequently use networks to represent the structure and function of the cell, using 
intuitive metaphors to reduce multiple levels of spatial and temporal relationships to a two-
dimensional image. At the same time, computational representations of the cell are more 
abstract and tend to be less intuitive for biologists than human-made diagrams. We are 
working to improve the biological relevance of computational visualizations of biological 
networks in Cytoscape, in collaboration with investigators leading driving biological projects 
and collaborative service projects. Intuitive biological network visualizations may one day 
replace printed biology textbooks as the primary resource for knowledge about cellular 
processes.</Abstract><Type>T</Type><Progress>We developed the thematic map plugin for Cytoscape, based on an earlier prototype 
presented in the grant application. This plugin ‘rolls-up’ node or edge attributes into their 
own nodes i.e. it transforms an input network into an attribute network, where node 
attributes are nodes and edges summarize all connections between nodes with the 
corresponding attributes in the original network. This view can be used in a number of 
biologically useful ways, including to summarize large protein-protein interaction networks 
in a simpler way. We are currently testing this plugin and it will be released in 2011.

In a similar spirit to the thematic map plugin, we developed the Enrichment Map plugin. 
Gene-set enrichment analysis is a useful technique to help functionally characterize large 
gene lists, such as the results of gene expression experiments. This technique finds 
functionally coherent gene-sets, such as pathways, that are statistically over-represented 
in a given gene list. Ideally, the number of resulting sets is smaller than the number of 
genes in the list, thus simplifying interpretation. However, the increasing number and 
redundancy of gene-sets used by many current enrichment analysis software works 
against this ideal. To overcome gene-set redundancy and help in the interpretation of 
large gene lists, we developed &quot;Enrichment Map&quot;, a network-based visualization method 
for gene-set enrichment results. Gene-sets are organized in a network, where each set is 
a node and edges represent gene overlap between sets. Automated network layout groups 
related gene-sets into network clusters, enabling the user to quickly identify the major 
enriched functional themes and more easily interpret the enrichment results. Enrichment 
Map is a significant advance in the interpretation of enrichment analysis. Any research 
project that generates a list of genes can take advantage of this visualization framework. 
Enrichment Map is implemented as a freely available and user friendly plug-in for the 
Cytoscape network visualization software (http://baderlab.org/Software/EnrichmentMap/) 
[1].

receiving feedback about the new API and will implement it fully in Cytoscape 3.1 [1]. 

We are also making progress on this project by helping to visualize biological pathways, in 
general. We have recently implemented BioPAX Level 3 support in Cytoscape (BioPAX 
Level 3 reader, writer and visualizer) [2]. This enables import of biological pathway 
information from various pathway databases, including Reactome [3], WikiPathways [4] 
and Pathway Commons [5], which will support future pathway visualization efforts.
We continue to closely collaborate with Charlie Boone and Brenda Andrews labs who lead 
our DBP: Synthetic genetic analysis of budding yeast (see DBP progress reports below).

communicates information about biological systems and provokes thought requires 
biological expertise and even a bit of artistry. These diagrams illustrate myriad interactions 
between genes, proteins and small molecules, and also their spatial and temporal 
arrangement. One of the most biologically intuitive ways to organize information about 
cellular systems is to place it in the context of a familiar physical map of the cell, with the 
nucleus surrounded by cytosol, organelles and a plasma membrane. Similarly, proteins 
known to be part of the same pathway should be placed close together in a diagram. A 
good source of information about a protein’s cellular location and biological process 
involvement is the Gene Ontology (GO) project [1], a collaborative effort to standardize 
nomenclature for biological concepts and link these to genes and proteins from many 
genomes. The GO project has developed three structured controlled vocabularies 
(ontologies) that describe gene products in terms of their associated biological processes, 
cellular components and molecular functions in a species-independent manner. Gene 
Ontology provides much broader coverage of genomes for this type of information than is 
available from any other source, such as traditional pathway models stored in pathway 
databases [2].

annotations to help organize nodes in a biologically relevant way. The first version of the 
GOLayout plugin is currently being tested and will be released in 2011. GOLayout first 
partitions a given network into subnetworks based on the biological process annotations, 
such as cell differentiation or cell cycle, provided by a pruned set of Gene Ontology called 
“GO slim” (Figure 1). Each subnetwork is laid out based on cellular component 
annotations over a scalable template of typical cell diagram. Finally, each node is colored 
based on a discrete mapping to molecular function annotation, such that all kinases, for 
example, might be colored green. The result is a biologically informative layout. Key 
aspects of the design and implementation of the plugin were done as part of an NRNB 
collaboration and service project with Allan Kuchinsky from Agilent Technologies, led by 
Annette Adler (Visualizing Biological Networks with a Biologist’s Eye).

biologically interesting paths within the layout, as well as better ontology handling, i.e., for

allows visualization of gene expression data on nodes that represent genes or proteins. 
Input to the system will be a data set of sub-gene or protein features, such as SNPs, 
exons or protein domains, and their associated data (e.g. population frequency, expression 
level or domain type). The parent node (gene) color would be based on the expression 
values of the exon, or could be based on a gene expression experiment, to allow 
comparison between exon expression and gene expression.

levels of abstraction with our ongoing work on group/metanode/module concepts and 
representations in Cytoscape. The initial benefits of this work are expressed in new 
metanode features, supporting the mapping of member node attributes up to the parent 
node using basic functions (ave, sum, min, max, median). Next, we will add weighted 
average, threshold and modal functions. This mapping infrastructure for metanodes is 
critical to all downstream visualization work with sub-gene and supra-gene level features 
and entities.
Proteins and genes in biological networks are associated with an increasing amount of 
data from multiple experiments, such as gene expression from time-series or across 
normal and disease states. Ideally, this multi-dimensional information would be visualized 
in the context of networks, but this is not possible with the current version of Cytoscape. 
We are extending the Cytoscape visual mapping system to support multiple node 
attributes at the same time using new types of visual attributes. Our primary DBP 
(Alternative splicing in embryonic stem cells, Mercola/Burnham Institute), for instance, 
requires this ability to view time series gene expression experiments. 
	Through a new collaboration and service project (Visualizing Multiple Attributes, 
Morris/UCSF), we coordinated on the design and implementation of the new nodeCharts 
plugin. This plugin provides an interface for drawing pie, line, bar charts, and histograms 
onto nodes using either attribute data or arbitrary data values (Figure 1).

	This work is just the beginning of our larger aim of supporting information layering 
and complex attribute visualization. There are other visual styles to add to nodeCharts, 
including radar, concentric, grid, etc. Furthermore, the current nodeCharts plugins 
provides only programmatic support through CyCommands. We will implement control 
panels that utilize this nodeCharts to present a user interface to support complex mapping 
decisions. Finally, connecting the mapping work with the visualization work, it will be 
important to consider the unique cases of visualizing aggregate information from sub-gene 
features to network nodes or from network nodes to metanodes.</Progress><Investigator><Person_ID>548480</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>P</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>548476</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Publication_ID>418393</Publication_ID>

D]</Title><AIDS_Flag>N</AIDS_Flag><Abstract>In spite of steady progress in the development of methods that automatically learn network 
models from data, these methods have not yet found broader use in the biological literature. 
The CYNI project aims to provide an easy-to-use interface for network inference algorithms 
making data-driven analysis of biological problems, including clustering and classification 
tasks, hypothesis generation from data and support for experiment design amenable to 
users of the Cytoscape software platform. It provides method developers with supporting 
functionality and technical infrastructure that makes it straightforward provide their 
software to a wider community. For tool users, the unified interface permits easy access to 
large number state-of-the-art methods allowing for the rapid adaptation of existing data-
processing workflows to new biological problems or the integration of novel tools in direct 
comparison with extant methods. We will use reference implementations of tools that 
demonstrate the new interface to method developers, and provide examples of their use in 
biological application projects.</Abstract><Type>T</Type><Progress>Although classification, clustering and network induction provide conceptually 
homogeneous approaches that a have a wide range practical problems, a large number of 
variations exist, for instance with respect to the choice of particular algorithms, the 
distance/similarity measures and the standardization of input data. For optimal results, 
these choices have to be made in compliance with desired properties of the results and are 
thus application-dependent.
 	To retain the flexibility and extensibility required for a widely applicable framework, 
CYNI follows a modular approach that allows functionality to be shared between tasks, and 
allows tailoring application-specific workflows from predefined building blocks. Specifically, 
the network induction consist of three stages:
 
1. An edge assessment using an information-theoretic measure,
2. A pathway aggregation step and
3. A component for experiment selection.

These stages can be supplemented by an optional pre-processing step. Moreover, the 
pathway aggregation step can be configured to harmonize with various edge scoring 
measures (the default setting being adapted to a general-purpose method that does not 
put restrictions on the interpretation of the edge weights). 	We applied this design to 
a network induction and experiment design methodology for de-novo identification of 
pathways from large-scale data within the BaSysBio project, which aims at the elucidation 
of regulatory networks in the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. The approach links 
an observed phenotype to an external perturbation, and is currently implemented as a 
series of stand-alone programs. Output is generated in several formats, including the .sif 
format read by Cytoscape.
 	Following the implementation of the Cyni-plugin interface, we are planning to 
integrate the developed algorithms as reference plugin implementations for demonstrating 
the network induction interface.</Progress><Investigator>

For the reporting period, NRNB has organized 8 training events (in 7 cities in 4 countries), 
with an additional 4 events already planned for 2011. These events include tutorials, 
workshops and courses. For the same period, NRNB investigators and collaborators have 
given 7 invited lectures. For 2011, several conferences are planned, including the annual 
Cytoscape retreat, which will take place on May 18-21 in San Diego, CA.

Open Tutorials:
We have developed a unique tutorial management system that caters to developers (with 
wiki tools for creating and updating content), presenters (with prepared slideshows and 
handouts), and students (with up-to-date online content). Open Tutorials 
(http://opentutorials.cgl.ucsf.edu) is now the primary source of tutorial material for the 
Cytoscape project. We recently created a new Cytoscape tutorial for &quot;Basic Expression 
Analysis&quot; that uses publicly available human experimental data. This tutorial, like the original 
tutorial for yeast, represents one of the most common use cases of Cytoscape for biologists. 
The site has received over 1,000 visitors in the past month, being used by individuals, 
developers and presenters.  This scalable tutorial management solution will allow NRNB to 
provide tutorial support services to a broad community.

http://cytoscape.org/CytoscapeRetreat2011/

Helpdesk:
One of the ways we provide support for NRNB tools is through dedicated helpdesk and 
discussion mailing lists. We have begun monitoring the activity of these lists for the 
Cytoscape community as an ongoing metric for the effectiveness of our support. As a 
starting baseline, this first year saw 723 messages and a response rate of ~61%. Some of 
the topics are informational posts that don’t require response, so we don’t expect 100%. 
However, we have identified an opportunity here for improvement. From an analysis of 
our mailing list patterns, we have identified three approaches for improving response rates 
and disseminating information to users:

 * Monthly response rates will be collected to identify months with lower than average 
response rates. A targeted strategy can then be employed to increase the response rate 
during these months.
 * The most common discussion topics and questions will be identified, in order to improve 
the dissemination of critical information to users. In addition to FAQ topics, we will use 
this information to create innovative context-specific solutions tailored to each question. 
For example, users often ask about the syntax for increased memory allocation for 
Cytoscape. This information could be communicated in an error message any time 
Cytoscape experiences a memory-related failure, before the user even formulates the 
question.
 * We are automating the analysis of helpdesk activity so that weekly alerts can be sent 
to NRNB staff whenever an email goes unanswered. This will allow us to maximize our 
response rate and quickly address gaps in our collective attention.

Social Media:
We have also initiated a social media effort for Cytoscape through a number of difference 
tools (http://www.cytoscape.org/community.html). For example, a Twitter account is used 
for quick announcements (http://twitter.com/cytoscape) and YouTube is utilized for video 
tutorials (http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cytoscape).

Google AdWords:
With our non-profit account, we are directly &gt;1,300 clicks a month to NRNB tools and 
resources via Google AdWords. This is worth just over $1,000 a month, which we are 
getting free-of-charge. Note: approx half of the traffic is for WikiPathways, which is not yet 
officially a NRNB resource (TBD).  We have a spending limit of $329 per day through this 
program, so we will continue to identify new ad words and relevant resources.

Google Summer of Code:
We were accepted as a mentoring organization in this year&apos;s GSoC program. Google 
allocated 10 student “slots” to us, which have filled with qualified and enthusiastic 
summer students. The students will write open source code for NRNB-related projects 
during the summer. This is equivalent to $55,000 paid out as student and mentor 
stipends.</Progress><Investigator><Person_ID>548476</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>P</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>548485</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Publication_ID>419631</Publication_ID><Publication_ID>445439</Publication_ID><Percent_Grant_Dollars>0</Percent_Grant_Dollars></Subproject><Subproject Sub_ID="305087"><Subproject_ID>0013</Subproject_ID><Title>DISSEMINATION AND ACCESS</Title><AIDS_Flag>N</AIDS_Flag><Abstract>This subproject tracks our efforts toward Dissemination and Access for both users and

understanding the molecular basis of cancer.  Initially, the project will focus on three 
cancer types: brain (glioblastoma multiforme), ovarian (serous cystadenocarcinoma), and 
lung (squamous carcinoma).   Each cancer type studied will generate a complete list of 
somatic mutations, copy number alterations, microRNA expression, mRNA expression, and 
epigenetic DNA methylation profiles for each matched tumor-normal sample. Mutation 
data for the second and third phases of the TCGA project will generate sequence data for 
~6,200 genes in &gt;200 matched tumor-normal pairs in GBM and ovarian cancers.  All 
samples include extensive clinical annotation, including patient age, gender, survival and 
treatment.
The TCGA Project is organized as a distributed research network across multiple research 
institutions within the United States (Figure 24).  Since 2006, MSKCC, under the direction 
of Marc Ladanyi (PI), has been a TCGA Cancer Genome Characterization Center (CGCC) for 
copy number analysis of all TCGA samples.  Using Agilent arrays, MSKCC provides 
characterization of chromosome segment gains and losses, and is also charged with 
developing new approaches for detecting novel genetic rearrangements.  Since 2007, the 
Computational Biology Center at MSKCC, under the direction of Chris Sander (PI) has also 
been extensively involved in the pathway and network analysis of GBM and ovarian 
cancers.  Sander’s group also currently chairs the Pathway Analysis subgroup for the TCGA

In 2009, Ladanyi and Sander jointly applied to create a Center for Translational Cancer 
Genomic Analysis at MSKCC (see next progress report)...  </Abstract><Type>C</Type><Progress>The MSKCC Center for Translational Cancer Genomic Analysis, a Genome Data Analysis 
Center type B (GDAC-B), was funded to develop novel integrative analysis methods for 
studying cancer genomic data, thereby enabling the translation of genomic insights into 
new clinical applications. The planned novel translational genomics analyses are presented 
in four specific aims organized around four themes: Subtype discovery. Pathway analysis, 
Therapy nomination, and Software development. These methods will be critical to helping 
the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project meet its stated objective of accelerating our 
understanding of the molecular basis of cancer, and improving our ability to diagnose, 
treat, and prevent cancer. The analysis work and method development will be closely 
coordinated with the GDACs working group (GDAC-WG), software tools will be fully 
integrated with the TCGA analytic pipelines and results of analyses will be made freely 
available to the scientific community via TCGA internet portals, with well-established plans 
for caBIG interoperability. The work of this GDAC-B will build on the flow of data from 
Genome Characterization Centers and Genome Sequencing Centers, as integrated by the 
GDAC-A data analysis centers. The applicant group of the MSKCC Center for Translational 
Cancer Genomic Analysis has a strong track record in large scale collaborative cancer 
genomics within the TCGA pilot phase and other consortia, and benefits from a 
computational biology program that is uniquely embedded in a comprehensive cancer 
center with a major focus on basic and translational research.

LEUKEMIA (CLL) [DBP 2]</Title><AIDS_Flag>N</AIDS_Flag><Abstract>Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is a malignancy of immune B cells. Under ordinary 
circumstances, these cells learn to recognize and help destroy foreign antigens as well as 
self-antigens that are abnormally expressed, such as in uncontrolled cell growth during 
cancer.  In CLL, however, malignant B cells are rendered unable to detect leukemia-
associated antigens.  Instead, they accumulate in patients&apos; blood, marrow, and lymphoid 
tissue.  Recently, the Kipps laboratory at the UCSD Moores Cancer Center has shown that 
B cells transduced to express the cell surface receptor CD154 are very effective at 
inducing anti-CLL cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Hence, viral transduction of Ad-CD154 is a 
potential strategy for gene therapy for patients with this disease [1].

After treatment with autologous Ad-CD154-transduced CLL cells, some patients are 
observed with an acute fall in leukemia cell counts while others are not.  To evaluate the 
mechanism(s) responsible for the acute fall in leukemia cell counts, this interdisciplinary 
DBP will bridge technology for network-based biomarker discovery (TRD A, Ideker and 
Sander) with clinical expertise in hematology/oncology at UCSD Moores Cancer Center 
(Kipps).  The Kipps group has gathered mRNA expression profiles for B-cells extracted from 
more than 200 patients with CLL, many of whom were seen by Kipps at UCSD.  This DBP 
will perform a network analysis of the CLL profiles to unveil gene subnetworks that help 
clear the accumulated B leukemia cells by CD154 transduction.  Moreover, this DBP will 
perform a network-based classification to predict the responsiveness of a newly diagnosed 
patient to this gene therapy.

Abstract: 
It is well known that humans tend to associate with other humans who have similar 
characteristics, but it is unclear whether this tendency has consequences for the 
distribution of genotypes in a population. Although geneticists have shown that 
populations tend to stratify genetically, this process results from geographic sorting or 
assortative mating, and it is unknown whether genotypes may be correlated as a 
consequence of nonreproductive associations or other processes. Here, we study six 
available genotypes from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to test for 
genetic similarity between friends. Maps of the friendship networks show clustering of 
genotypes and, after we apply strict controls for population stratification, the results show 
that one genotype is positively correlated (homophily) and one genotype is negatively 
correlated (heterophily). A replication study in an independent sample from the 
Framingham Heart Study verifies that DRD2 exhibits significant homophily and that 
CYP2A6 exhibits significant heterophily. These unique results show that homophily and 
heterophily obtain on a genetic (indeed, an allelic) level, which has implications for the 
study of population genetics and social behavior. In particular, the results suggest that 
association tests should include friends&apos; genes and that theories of evolution should take 
into account the fact that humans might, in some sense, be metagenomic with respect to 
the humans around them.</Progress><Investigator>

DIFFERENTIATION [DBP 4]</Title><AIDS_Flag>N</AIDS_Flag><Abstract>Deciphering the genetic and cellular programs that lead to differentiation of embryonic 
stem cells (ESCs) into cardiac precursor cells and the subsequent development into cardiac 
cells has been the subject of intense research over the past decade. Efforts to regenerate 
damaged heart using a variety of methods ranging from extraneous incorporation of ESCs 
to introduction of specific proteins and small molecules have been unsuccessful even 
though this has led to significant insights. Numerous signaling molecules and transcription 
factors have been shown to participate directly or indirectly at various stages of 
cardiomyogenesis.

Despite this progress, it is still not possible to efficiently program ESCs to develop into 
cardiomyocytes using known proteins. This is most likely because our knowledge of the 
factors involved is incomplete. Another critical limitation is that we do not yet know how 
to manipulate the known differentiation factors and signaling pathways, many of which 
must be added or activated within particular time windows to be effective. Although we 
have precise knowledge of many components of the possible signal transduction cascades 
that are stimulated by heart-inducing factors, there is only sparse knowledge of how the 
many signaling pathways are coordinately modulated by the finely tuned, combinatorial 
action of these inducers during embryonic or ESC cardiogenesis. Furthermore, the 
signaling components themselves have been worked out largely by manipulation of 
cardiogenic cells with single proteins such that it is not certain that a putative cascade 
actually operates as it has been described – instead it may be a more complex network. 
While several transcriptional control elements in human ESCs have been identified, the 
function of alternative isoforms in self-renewal, pluripotency, and tissue lineage 
specification remains largely unknown. 

Through NHLBI funding, the Mercola laboratory is developing contextually appropriate and 
information-rich data sets that track the differentiation of ESCs during cardiomyogenesis. 
Through collaboration between this DBP and RAVIN TRD C, we will analyze these data to 
reconstruct models of the detailed signaling and regulatory networks involved in this 
process. The experimental readouts from the Mercola laboratory provide a wealth of data 
that needs to be assimilated and integrated into quantitative models in order to decipher 
the detailed networks underlying cardiomyogenesis. This will form the first and main 
biomedical application to be addressed through technology developed in TRD C.</Abstract><Type>C</Type><Progress>New publication:

Abstract:
Two major goals of regenerative medicine are to reproducibly transform adult somatic cells 
into a pluripotent state and to control their differentiation into specific cell fates. Progress 
toward these goals would be greatly helped by obtaining a complete picture of the RNA 
isoforms produced by these cells due to alternative splicing (AS) and alternative promoter 
selection (APS). To investigate the roles of AS and APS, reciprocal exon-exon junctions 
were interrogated on a genome-wide scale in differentiating mouse embryonic stem (ES) 
cells with a prototype Affymetrix microarray. Using a recently released open-source 
software package named AltAnalyze, we identified 144 genes for 170 putative isoform 
variants, the majority (67%) of which were predicted to alter protein sequence and 
domain composition. Verified alternative exons were largely associated with pathways of 
Wnt signaling and cell-cycle control, and most were conserved between mouse and 
human. To examine the functional impact of AS, we characterized isoforms for two genes. 
As predicted by AltAnalyze, we found that alternative isoforms of the gene Serca2 were 
targeted by distinct microRNAs (miRNA-200b, miRNA-214), suggesting a critical role for 
AS in cardiac development. Analysis of the Wnt transcription factor Tcf3, using selective 
knockdown of an ES cell-enriched and characterized isoform, revealed several distinct 
targets for transcriptional repression (Stmn2, Ccnd2, Atf3, Klf4, Nodal, and Jun) as well as 
distinct differentiation outcomes in ES cells. The findings herein illustrate a critical role for 
AS in the specification of ES cells with differentiation, and highlight the utility of global 
functional analyses of AS.</Progress><Investigator>

reference map provides a model for expanding genetic network analysis to higher organisms, 
and it will stimulate valuable insights into gene function, drug target and mode-of-action 
analysis. The resulting complete map of genetic interactions for budding yeast, with ~6000 
genes, will contain 36 million quantitative interaction pairs (18 million unique pairs). The 
current data set already represents over 6 million pairs uncovering over 170,000 high 
confidence genetic interactions. To effectively organize and interpret this enormous network, 
RAVIN personnel led by Drs. Bader and Conklin (TRD C) will develop new visualization 
methods to explore the modularity of the genetic network, to show only the information 
needed at a specific level of detail, and to create simplified views of the network, focusing on 
specific systems of interest.</Abstract><Type>C</Type><Progress>The fundamental principle underlying this DBP is that we need to discover the rules 
governing how genes interact with one another in order to be able to predict which rare 
combinations of gene mutations cause human disease or other significant phenotypes.  
Andrews and Boone aim to discover the general principles of genetic interaction by 
mapping the first complete genetic interaction network for a eukaryotic cell and directly 
testing the conservation of these principles.  They are taking a unique experimental 
approach to define and dissect the rules of complex genetic networks. The strategy entails 
the use of combinatorial genetic perturbations to systematically screen for genetic 
interactions.  In particular, they have established key infrastructure that enables the 
construction of all possible double gene deletion mutant combinations in genetically 
tractable yeast model systems in an automated, high throughput manner. Genetic 
interactions are subsequently scored by assessing extreme phenotypes that result from 
the collapse of an essential cellular function.  This information is assembled into a network 
that reflects the genetic landscape of a cell.
The approach is paying off. During the reporting period NRNB investigator, Gary Bader, has 
collaborated with Drs. Boone and Andrews on 3 new publications, extracting knowledge 
about protein complexes [1], regions of protein disorder [2] and physiological fitness [3] 
from comparisons of genetic interactions on a genome scale. Each of these published 
projects utilized Cytoscape.

6]</Title><AIDS_Flag>N</AIDS_Flag><Abstract>This DBP attempts to find innovative strategies to stimulate innate immune defense 
mechanisms.  It can be seen in the perspective of the current attempts at preventing and 
treating infectious diseases, or situations of conflict between the host and its commensal 
flora. 

The aim of this DBP is to identify novel immunomodulators stimulating antimicrobial 
defense mechanisms and epithelial restitution without eliciting significant inflammation. 
The significance of these immunomodulators would be to prevent or treat recurrent or 
chronic enteric infections that are currently untreatable.  Availability of such molecules 
would also have enormous potential in the treatment of other diseases such as the 
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD, e.g. Crohn’s Disease). Many IBDs encompass a strong 
component of suppression of the innate antimicrobial mechanisms keeping the gut flora in 
check, particularly epithelial defensins [1].  Such molecules would also be beneficial in 
preventing systemic infections following bacterial intestinal translocations in the course of 
aggressive, bone marrow suppressive poly-chemotherapies for some cancers, lymphomas 
and leukemias.

Aim 1, that seeks to establish a network of gene regulation, will involve global 
transcriptomic profiling of cells in which key genes are perturbed by RNA interference. 
These data will serve as the basis for the inference of a gene regulatory network, which 
will be derived using the iterative network inference project developed in TRD D. The 
expertise of the DBP experimental collaborators will be essential in driving this process. 
The inferred network, in turn, will serve to generate hypotheses that will be verified in 
vivo in Aim 2. Furthermore, the inferred regulatory network will imply a set of hypotheses 
about the effects of perturbing different network genes by RNAi. The results of the high-
throughput cell-based screening in Aim 3 will validate these predictions. Accordingly, the 
DBP project represents a comprehensive and compatible use case for the technologies 
developed in TRD D, and it will challenge and apply all aspects of the proposed technology.

relationship between social networks and health in the National Longitudinal Study of 
Adolescent Health (AddHealth) with an emphasis on understanding the role of social 
networks and their genetic precursors. The AddHealth data were collected in two waves 
between 1994 and 1996. In 2001 and 2002, AddHealth respondents, 18 to 26 years old, 
were also re-interviewed in a third wave to investigate the influence that adolescence has on 
young adulthood. For the present work, we will conceptualize “health” as three health 
behavioral outcomes: smoking, drinking, and overweight.

Although this CSP involves the same biomedical collaborator as DBP 3 (Christakis), the two 
projects are distinct in biology and technology.  In terms of biology, the focus of DBP 3 is on 
the role of adult social networks in the spread of behaviors that influence obesity and 
smoking.  In contrast, the focus of this CSP is on the role of genes that influence 
interactions in adolescent friendship networks and how these interactions, in turn, influence 
the health of an individual.  In terms of technology, our focus here is on network properties 
such as centrality and clustering in contrast to the trend motifs and regression models of 
DBP 3.  This CSP will benefit from the network analysis technology being advanced in TRD B

[CSP 3]</Title><AIDS_Flag>N</AIDS_Flag><Abstract>Our collaborators in the Wrensch laboratory are engaged in four activities encompassing 
genomic, bioinformatic, biostatistical, and laboratory methods to study the genetic and 
molecular epidemiology of adult glioma. The overarching hypothesis of this work is that 
novel inherited variation in glioma susceptibility and prognosis can be identified (or 
confirmed) through integration of new genomic technologies and 
bioinformatic/biostatistical tools with high-quality subject resources. They further 
hypothesize that demographic, environmental, and immunological factors are likely to 
influence such susceptibility, and that different constellations of factors may be involved 
with different histologic and molecular subtypes of glioma.
The project has completed genotyping of existing adult glioma subjects and controls on 
the Illumina 370duo.  The Wrensch lab has recently submitted a genome wide association 
study (GWAS) for publication showing, with replication data from the Mayo Clinic, that 
areas of 9p21 and RTEL1 may be involved in glioma susceptibility. In addition the project 
has developed a publicly available, novel tool (www.SNPLogic.org) for SNP selection, 
prioritization and annotation. SNPLogic aids in rational SNP selection, prioritization, and 
interpretation for SNP disease association studies. SNPLogic has several unique 
advantages over other public SNP annotation systems: availability of user/group accounts 
with an unlimited number of created and saved SNP lists, flexible three-level SNP list 
sharing, and a powerful user-defined SNP scoring system. This program has proven 
invaluable in selecting the most cost-effective genotyping panel for, and in interpreting 
results from, this study.
The ability of SNPLogic to associate other data with SNP lists such as pathway and gene 
enrichment data will require that we provide links to tools such as WikiPathways, 
GenMAPP-CS and Cytoscape. Enhanced visualization support as described in TRD C will 
facilitate the visualization of SNP context at the level of pathways and individual protein 
structure models. Other efforts will include the use of webservices at WikiPathways 
(http://www.wikipathways.org/ - a relates network biology resource), to generate 
pathway images with the genes colored based on SNP information, which will have 
clickable links back to the SNP list table. We will also enhance protein structure 
visualization using Chimera [http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/] and Cytoscape using SNP 
coordinates and known PDB IDs to return a 3D model with the SNP region highlighted.</Abstract><Type>C</Type><Progress></Progress><Investigator><Person_ID>548476</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>548499</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>P</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Percent_Grant_Dollars>0</Percent_Grant_Dollars></Subproject><Subproject Sub_ID="305098"><Subproject_ID>0024</Subproject_ID><Title>VISUALIZING BIOLOGICAL NETWORKS WITH A BIOLOGIST’S

metaphors to reduce multiple levels of spatial and temporal relationships to a two-
dimensional page. Such representations serve as useful models to summarize a body of 
knowledge or to propose hypothetical interactions. Making these models accessible to 
computation and data mapping is an important and timely effort coinciding with advances 
in high-throughput generation of genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data. At the same 
time, computational representations can be more abstract and less intuitive for biologists 
than human-curated networks. This is because computational models do not easily 
represent the unstructured annotation information that underlies the conceptual richness 
of the curated network.  

These issues are of high priority to Agilent, which markets a suite of genomics, 
proteomics, and systems biology software applications, in addition to hardware 
instrumentation.  Agilent has been a strong supporter of the Cytoscape project since its 
inception, and has had several in-house programmers working on Cytoscape core code or 
plugins for the past several years.

Researchers need tools to not only aid in the collection and processing of large-scale 
datasets, but also to help make sense of the data and place it in the familiar context of 
biological pathways. By modeling the data to allow for a more direct mapping of large and 
diverse datasets we will lower the barrier between data collection and hypotheses. 
Furthermore, we will enrich the connection between the actual data, e.g. relating to a 
particular exon, and the network of genes and proteins by defining the possible transcripts 
and isoforms to which that exon contributes.</Abstract><Type>C</Type><Progress></Progress><Investigator><Person_ID>548476</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>548501</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>P</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Percent_Grant_Dollars>0</Percent_Grant_Dollars></Subproject><Subproject Sub_ID="305099"><Subproject_ID>0025</Subproject_ID><Title>MOLECULAR PROFILING IN HEART DISEASE BIOMARKER 
DISCOVERY [CSP 5]</Title><AIDS_Flag>N</AIDS_Flag><Abstract>Cardiovascular disease (CVD), and heart failure (HF) specifically, is a leading cause of 
mortality in North America. Despite recent progress, the molecular mechanisms of 
cardiomyopathies that result in decreased cardiac contractility and ultimately overt HF 
remain unclear. Given the recent association of microRNA (miRNA) inhibition of protein 
synthesis to the development of cardiac hypertrophy and HF [1,2], we have initiated a 
collaborative effort to identify and characterize miRNAs active in validated mouse models 
of dilated (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We have also completed 
quantitative global surveys of protein and mRNA in a time-course study of DCM disease 
progression. We have obtained preliminary evidence that specific miRNAs differentially 
accumulate and modulate select protein targets under pathological conditions.
In this application, we propose to advance these studies and uncover the identities, 
targets and biological effects of all miRNAs linked to the pathology of cardiomyopathy and 
HF. Specifically, we will extend our preliminary results and establish the miRNA-target 
regulatory pathways affected in DCM and other mouse models of HF. We will validate our 
top-ranked predictions by stringent independent experimental methods. We will use 
genetic knock-down plus transgenic over-expression technologies, cell biological assays, 
and high-throughput imaging to investigate the effects of perturbation of individual 
miRNAs and their targets on disease progression to HF. We expect that modulation of key 
miRNA-target effectors will ameliorate the cardiac phenotype. This proposal builds on a

maladaptive response to perturbed calcium handling that ultimately leads to catastrophic

This project will benefit from the RAVIN resource through access to transforming 
technology for network analysis of miRNA data. Using the BIoNetMarker plugin we will 
transform a gene-by-gene miRNA analysis to summarize miRNA in the context of

components at multiple levels of information flow in order to understand the global 
regulation of gene transcription in bacteria at the system level. To achieve this objective, 
BaSysBio is focusing on developing and adapting high-throughput technologies to facilitate 
quantitative measurements, in conjunction with developing and validating computational 
systems biology methodologies to enable the quantitative interpretation of the data and 
unravel the underlying principles of regulatory network interactions.

Experimental data are generated in the highly tractable Gram-positive model bacterium 
Bacillus subtilis with two specific goals: (1) to unravel the global regulatory structure of B. 
subtilis metabolism to understand how transcriptional regulation is integrated with the 
other levels of control; (2) to achieve a quantitative understanding of the cellular 
transcriptional responses under conditions mimicking pathogenesis, and to apply the 
acquired knowledge and the integrated modeling/experiments strategy developed in the 
model bacterium to understand the regulatory networks controlling pathogenesis in the 
closely related disease-causing bacteria Bacillus anthracis and Staphylococcus aureus.

Involvement of NRNB will give access to new concepts in computational network inference 
to facilitate the comprehension of biological complexity. BaSysBio will develop explicative 
dynamic regulation models that include transcription, translation, and metabolic 
processes. Beyond fostering a deeper understanding of transcriptional control in B. subtilis 
and related pathogens through a systems-based approach, BaSysBio aims at developing 
novel methodologies in several areas that will be critical for the future development of 
systems biology including predictive, large-scale mathematical modeling, efficient coupling 
between experimentation and computation, elucidation of general design principles, and 
the effective application of methods and knowledge on model organisms to related, yet 
less well-characterized species.</Abstract><Type>C</Type><Progress></Progress><Investigator><Person_ID>548481</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>548503</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>P</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Percent_Grant_Dollars>0</Percent_Grant_Dollars></Subproject><Subproject Sub_ID="305101"><Subproject_ID>0027</Subproject_ID><Title>GENETIC NETWORKS UNDERLYING DNA DAMAGE</Title><AIDS_Flag>N</AIDS_Flag><Abstract>Abstract
Although cellular behaviors are dynamic, the networks that govern these behaviors have 
been mapped primarily as static snapshots. Using an approach called differential epistasis 
mapping, we have discovered widespread changes in genetic interaction among yeast 
kinases, phosphatases, and transcription factors as the cell responds to DNA damage. 
Differential interactions uncover many gene functions that go undetected in static 
conditions. They are very effective at identifying DNA repair pathways, highlighting new 
damage-dependent roles for the Slt2 kinase, Pph3 phosphatase, and histone variant Htz1. 
The data also reveal that protein complexes are generally stable in response to 
perturbation, but the functional relations between these complexes are substantially 
reorganized. Differential networks chart a new type of genetic landscape that is invaluable 
for mapping cellular responses to stimuli.

AD</Title><AIDS_Flag>N</AIDS_Flag><Abstract>It has been known for more than forty years that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brains exhibit 
extracellular amyloid beta protein (Abeta) plaques and intracellular protein aggregates 
known as neurofibrillary tangles. However, the mechanism by which Abeta causes AD has 
remained elusive. We propose a novel in vivo quantitative proteomic approach to 
determine the effects of Abeta on the aging brain proteome to uncover detailed AD 
pathological mechanism(s). We will apply a recently developed stable isotope protein 
labeling method to the investigation of AD pathology. The strength of our approach stems 
from our ability to simultaneously determine the relative expression level of thousands of 
proteins in a single analysis thus providing the means to test many cellular pathways of 
potential relevance to AD and normal aging. We hypothesize that the identification of 
proteins with perturbed expression in the affected brain regions of multiple AD mouse 
models will reveal pathways critical to AD pathology. Further, we will also determine the 
changes in protein abundance in brain during normal aging to gain insight into potential 
risk factors associated with the age of AD onset. To validate our observations, the levels of 
the candidate proteins will be investigated in human AD brain by quantitative mass 
spectrometry and western blot. We will attempt to rescue AD pathology by correcting 
protein expression in AD model; cells, worms, and mice. Subsequently, we will use 
biochemical and molecular approaches to investigate the mechanism responsible for 
altered protein expression. Ultimately we aim to determine the pathological molecules and 
forces responsible for AD which could eventually lead to the development of an effective
treatment for AD.

Mapping the proteins we find altered in AD onto the cytoscape network represents an 
enormous opportunity to find new and exciting potential AD drug targets.

has focused on genomics. While this has provided significant insights into disease 
pathogenesis, the field of epigenetics is underdeveloped, and most of the current work 
focuses on microRNA. The critical importance of DNA methylation in autoreactivity and in 
neoplasia, the role of environmental stress on DNMT expression, and the potential for 
vertical transmission of risk across generations has drawn us to DNMTs as critical regulators 
in RA. Our proposal is novel in that it implicates methylation in risk as well as an amplifying 
factor that can alter the natural history of disease due to the synovial inflammatory disease. 
   We have already investigated the difference of methylation patterns at a given CpG site 
between RA synovial fibroblasts and control samples. We found that methylation patterns of 
more than 300 genes are totally different. In this time, we are going to investigate their 
networks using Cytoscape, and then we will decide the genes we have to investigate next.

TRANSCRIPTION IN 
ES CELLS</Title><AIDS_Flag>N</AIDS_Flag><Abstract>The major goal of this proposal is to reveal molecular mechanisms underlying formation 
and function of critical transcriptional assemblies essential to embryonic stem (ES) cells 
and cells with induced pluripotency (induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells). Using 
bioinformatics and high throughput experimental methods, we will prepare defined 
domains of critical transcriptional factors controlling cell pluripotency and analyze them in 
their functional associations. Thousands of assemblies will be evaluated by biochemical 
and biophysical methods to identify the critical ones to be targeted by X-ray 
crystallography. We aim for determination of three-dimensional structures for about 100 
stable multi-component transcriptional assemblies. Each of them will represent a partial 
image of complicated transcriptional machinery controlling the specific transcriptional 
landscape of pluripotent cells. We expect that thoughtful analyses of these structures will 
enable us to establish the proper connections between these partial images and 
reconstruct a general model for function of critical participants of this transcriptional 
machinery. We will justify this model and the observed regulatory interactions within 
identified transcriptional complexes in mutational and functional studies using iPS cells. 
The experiments are to be done at multiple sites: The Methodist Hospital Research 
Institute (Houston), Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at UCSF, the Gladstone 
Institute of Cardiovascular Disease (UCSF) and X-ray crystallography by the PSI labs. The 
proposed structural and functional studies will propel our general knowledge of the basic 
mechanisms controlling cell fate, including those underlying self renewal, differentiation 
and pathogenesis of cancer. The results of this research will also provide more efficient 
molecular tools allowing precise control over cell programming and reprogramming. The 
accumulated structural and functional data would be immediately available to biochemical 
and clinical researchers, and therefore, would have a major impact on stem cell research 
as well as regenerative medicine. 

NRNB staff is collaborating with Dr. Yumoto to assist with target selection and 
prioritization.  Using the GeneMania Cytoscape plugin, NRNB staff has to identified a set of 
related genes to be considered as possible targets, starting from the list of already 
identified targets. NRNB staff also constructed a pathway at WikiPathways by augmenting 
a pluripotency-related pathway with targets and interaction information provided by Dr. 
Yumoto. Both the network visualizations from Cytoscape and the pathway diagram have 
been used in presentations and grant progress reports.

based upon the idea that exposure to excess glucose will set off a
cascade of deleterious events, initially driven by over-production of
mitochondrial superoxide anions. Our data using cell culture, animal
models and human subjects strongly favors a completely different
hypothesis. We hypothesize that mitochondrial function and mitochondrial
superoxide anion production is shut down in response to exposure to
excess glucose. This effect, termed the Crabtree effect, if persistent
will lead to Warburg metabolism which is closely tied to production of
disease-promoting pro-fibrotic and inflammatory molecules.

The proposed studies will test this hypothesis in patients with type 1
diabetes at the metabolomic and epigenetic level and in experimental
systems to prove our hypothesis and establish the molecular mechanisms
driving this course of events in the diabetic kidney. Metabolomic and
epigenetic markers of reduced mitochondrial function and biogenesis will
be performed in urine samples from patients in the FINN-DIANE and CRIC
cohort. The significance of reduced mitochondrial function will lead to
progressive cell dysfunction and consequent reduction in the glomerular
filtration rate and renal failure. We postulate that the pathogenetic
mechanism mediating the shutdown of mitochondria in diabetes is via
inhibition of the AMPK pathway leading to inhibition of PGC1a thus
inhibiting mitogenesis. AMPK regulation of autophagy is also impaired by
reducing beclin 1 thus leading to retention of impaired mitochondria.
Thus impaired mitogenesis and impaired mitophagy sets off an
inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cascade. The role of this pathway will be
tested in mouse models of diabetic kidney disease using novel imaging
tools and cell specific deletion of AMPK and PGC1a.

A systems biology approach will be used to demonstrate novel biomarkers
that closely reflect and track renal mitochondrial status at the
metabolomic and epigenetic level.

signalling pathways. Defects in the formation or function of primary cilia are associated 
with a spectrum of human diseases and developmental abnormalities. Genetic screens in 
model organisms have discovered core machineries of cilium assembly and maintenance. 
However, regulatory molecules that coordinate the biogenesis of primary cilia with other 
cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization, vesicle trafficking and cell-cell 
adhesion, remain to be identified. Here we report the results of a functional genomic 
screen using RNA interference (RNAi) to identify human genes involved in ciliogenesis 
control. The screen identified 36 positive and 13 negative ciliogenesis modulators, which 
include molecules involved in actin dynamics and vesicle trafficking. Further investigation 
demonstrated that blocking actin assembly facilitates ciliogenesis by stabilizing the 
pericentrosomal preciliary compartment (PPC), a previously uncharacterized compact 
vesiculotubular structure storing transmembrane proteins destined for cilia during the 
early phase of ciliogenesis. The PPC was labelled by recycling endosome markers. 
Moreover, knockdown of modulators that are involved in the endocytic recycling pathway 
affected the formation of the PPC as well as ciliogenesis. Our results uncover a critical 
regulatory step that couples actin dynamics and endocytic recycling with ciliogenesis, and 
also provides potential target molecules for future study.

research effort of every project and collaboration engaged by the NRNB. As such, the 
development and maintenance of Cytoscape receives a large amount of attention. Cytoscape 
development is progressing along two fronts: we are continuing to maintain the existing 2.8 
series of releases and we are developing version 3.0 of Cytoscape which represents an 
evolution of our architecture designed to modularize the core of Cytoscape, define a clear 
and consistent API, and simplify the experience of developing and maintaining plugins for 
Cytoscape. </Abstract><Type>T</Type><Progress>We released Cytoscape 2.8.0 in October of 2010 and a subsequent maintenance release 
2.8.1 in February of 2011.  Version 2.8 introduces two powerful new features that when 
used together can create rich visualization.  These features are custom node graphics and 
attribute equations.  Custom node graphics allow Cytoscape end users to map arbitrary 
graphical images onto nodes in a Cytoscape network using the existing VizMapper 
interface.  Attribute equations provide Excel like functionality to the Cytoscape attribute 
browser.  We provide a variety of functions that allow normal Cytoscape attributes 
(numbers, strings, lists) to be manipulated in common ways within Cytoscape.  The 
purpose of attribute equations isn’t to supplant the use of R or Excel for data analysis, but 
rather to provide a convenient way for users to manipulate data within Cytoscape.  
Combining custom node graphics with attribute equations allow us to generate exciting 
graphics relatively easily.  For example, given a Cytoscape node attribute of  a PDB 
identifier, we’re able to write an equation that concatenates the identifier string together 
with URL parts to produce a complete URL pointing to an image of the 3D structure 
provided on the PDB website.  We’re then able to map this URL to a node where the URL 
gets interpreted as an image resulting in the 3D structure of the specified proteins being 
displayed on the nodes of the network.
In conjunction with Cytoscape 2.8, we’ve also been developing the next generation of 
Cytoscape, version 3.0.  The Cytoscape 3.0 development effort has resulted in the first 
developer milestone release of 3.0 at the end of January 2011.  The purpose of this 
milestone was to present a functioning application to the core Cytoscape development 
team so that they could begin porting plugins and to use and critique the 3.0 API.  The 
Bader Group ported a number of core plugins from 2.8, including BioPAX and 
PathwayCommons and implemented session reading and writing. In early March 2011 we 
held a small meeting of core developers at UC San Diego to discuss the design of 
Cytoscape 3.0 and to plan the remaining development.  We are currently on track to 
release developer milestone 2 prior to the 2011 Cytoscape retreat.
The primary goal of Cytoscape 3.0 is to have feature parity with Cytoscape 2.X, but there 
will be new features included as well.  We have begun initial development on a “Quick 
Start” plugin designed to help novice users get their attribute and network data into 
Cytoscape was quickly and easily as possible.</Progress><Investigator><Person_ID>453037</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>P</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>548479</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>548476</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>548477</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Publication_ID>419645</Publication_ID>

common forms of heart disease. We have used shotgun MS/MS to monitor the state of 
biological systems in cardiac tissue correlating with disease onset, cardiac insufficiency and 
progression to heart failure in a time-course mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy. 
However, interpreting the functional significance of the hundreds of differentially expressed 
proteins has been challenging. Here, we utilize improved enrichment statistical methods and 
an extensive collection of functionally related gene sets, gaining a more comprehensive 
understanding of the progressive alterations associated with functional decline in dilated 
cardiomyopathy. We visualize the enrichment results as an Enrichment Map, where 
significant gene sets are grouped based on annotation similarity. This approach vastly 
simplifies the interpretation of the large number of enriched gene sets found. For pathways 
of specific interest, such as Apoptosis and the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) 
cascade, we performed a more detailed analysis of the underlying signaling network, 
including experimental validation of expression patterns.

also to suppress B cell development in the thymus. Subsequently, Notch-1 activation 
regulates survival and maturation of early T cell progenitors as they migrate through the 
thymic cortex. Members of two structurally distinct families of Notch ligands, Delta-like 
and Jagged, are widely expressed in lymphoid tissues. We have shown that Lunatic Fringe 
critically regulates Notch-1 activation during multiple early stages of intrathymic T cell 
development (Immunity, 2001; Nature Immunology, 2005).

Our genetic approaches have revealed that Lunatic Fringe endows T cell progenitors with 
the ability to compete for functionally limiting Delta-like Notch ligands in specific micro-
environmental niches. Our current goals are to: 1) identify the genetic targets of Notch-1 
signaling in early T cell progenitors, 2) identify the micro-environmental niches where 
intrathymic Notch-1 activation takes place, and 3) determine how dysregulation of Notch-
1 signaling causes T cell leukemia.

In contrast to T cell development, B cell development in the bone marrow does not require 
Notch activation. Newly formed B cells migrate from the bone marrow to the spleen, 
where most develop into follicular (Fo) B cells, the major recirculating T-dependent B cell 
subset. However, a small subset develops into marginal zone (MZ) B cells in response to 
Notch-2 activation by Delta-like1. Unlike Fo B cells, MZ B cells are sessile cells that reside 
near the marginal sinus in the red pulp of the spleen where they can be activated by 
bacterial cell wall polysaccharides in a T cell-independent fashion, thus providing crucial 
protection against bacterial sepsis.

Our current goals are to: 1) determine which cells in the spleen present Dll-1 to induce 
MZ B cell development, 2) determine how Fringe proteins regulate Notch-2-Dll-1 
interactions during MZ B cell development, 3) investigate molecular mechanisms by which 
Notch-2 regulates MZ B cell development, and 4) determine how Fringe proteins regulate 
Notch-Dll-1 interactions to control T cell activation and homoestasis in peripheral lymphoid 
tissues.</Abstract><Type>C</Type><Progress></Progress><Investigator><Person_ID>548526</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>P</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>548479</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>554097</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>554093</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Percent_Grant_Dollars>0</Percent_Grant_Dollars></Subproject><Subproject Sub_ID="305416"><Subproject_ID>0046</Subproject_ID><Title>PATHWAY AND NETWORK ANALYSIS OF PEDIATRIC BRAIN TUMOURS</Title><AIDS_Flag>N</AIDS_Flag><Abstract>Brain tumors are the most common solid malignancies observed in children, and the most 
common cause of pediatric cancer death. The most common pediatric brain cancer, 
medulloblastoma, originates in the cerebellum, and then metastasizes through the spinal 
fluid to the rest of the brain and spinal cord. Survival rates have increased to &gt;60% 
secondary to the surgery, whole brain and spinal cord radiation, and aggressive 
chemotherapy used in modern treatment. Survivors however are often left devastated 
with cognitive, physical, reproductive, social, and neurological deficits due to both the 
disease and its therapy. As survivors are children, they represent a long-term economic 
and societal challenge to Canadian healthcare, and a significant burden of suffering.
While originally thought to encompass one disease, our recent pilot study of 100 tumors 
demonstrates that medulloblastoma is in fact a heterogeneous group of diseases with 
distinct demographics, clinical presentations, histology, transcriptomes, cancer genetics, 
and clinical outcome. Some children are undoubtedly over-treated and suffer needless 
complications, while others rapidly expire despite what is likely futile therapy. To address 
this heterogeneity we formed the Medulloblastoma Advanced Genomics International 
Consortium (MAGIC), which is composed of &gt;45 leading pediatric neuro-oncology centers 
from around the world who have contributed &gt;1200 high quality frozen medulloblastomas 
to our tumor bank at Sick Kids. Our diverse group of clinical and basic science investigators 
from across Canada and around the world will:
1) Discover biologically driven and clinically important homogeneous subgroups of 
medulloblastoma through whole transcriptome profiling of 1000 tumors, and develop 
reliable and robust biomarkers for subgroup identification in clinical trials.
2) Prioritize genomic studies on tumors from children with molecularly defined high risk 
subgroups of medulloblastoma, and/or a worse quality of life in order to improve functional 
outcomes and diminish health care expenditures (GE3LS).
3) Discover tumor subgroup specific somatic mutations in order to inform current clinical 
trials of targeted therapies being tested in medulloblastoma, and to identify novel genes 
and pathways already targeted in other diseases, and for which therapy could be rapidly 
transitioned to Phase II trials in medulloblastoma.
4)	Apply economic methodology with Canadian families and oncologists to determine 
the proper balance between increased risks of tumor recurrence versus increased quality 
of life after therapy de-escalation as a guide to develop the next generation of clinical trials 
for children with medulloblastoma (GE3LS).
Through development of a comprehensive biologically based stratification of 
medulloblastoma patients we hope to diminish excessive and futile therapies, identify 
children at risk for disabling and expensive complications, and identify novel targets for 
therapy of children who currently have no significant options for clinical trials, and hence 
little hope. This project builds upon the globally recognized Canadian strength in pediatric 
neuro-oncology, and the MAGIC consortium allows us to ask questions that cannot be 
duplicated elsewhere in the world. Our co-applicants include individuals with roles in 
clinical trial agencies from around the world, which we anticipate will allow rapid 
translational of the benefits of stratified treatment to improve outcomes for children with 
brain cancer and to realize reduce health care expenditure in Canada and around the 
world. Our approach to de-escalate therapy for children with good prognosis tumors will 
result in immediate diminished acute health care costs and decreased need for expensive 
long-term care of disabled children and adults. Identification of biomarkers for children 
who are currently over-treated, in combination with data that will quantify and validate 
parent’s acceptance of therapy de-escalation will guide the next generation of clinical trials 
across North America and Europe within the time frame of the granting period there-by 
providing societal, economic, clinical, and academic benefits to Canada.</Abstract><Type>C</Type><Progress></Progress><Investigator><Person_ID>548527</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>P</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>548479</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>554094</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Percent_Grant_Dollars>0</Percent_Grant_Dollars></Subproject><Subproject Sub_ID="305417"><Subproject_ID>0047</Subproject_ID><Title>PATHWAY AND NETWORK ANALYSIS OF AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER</Title><AIDS_Flag>N</AIDS_Flag><Abstract>The autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of conditions characterized by 
impairments in reciprocal social interaction and communication, and the presence of 
restricted and repetitive behaviours. Individuals with an ASD vary greatly in cognitive 
development, which can range from above average to intellectual disability. Although ASDs 
are known to be highly heritable ( approximately 90%), the underlying genetic determinants 
are still largely unknown. Here we analysed the genome-wide characteristics of rare (&lt;1% 
frequency) copy number variation in ASD using dense genotyping arrays. When comparing 
996 ASD individuals of European ancestry to 1,287 matched controls, cases were found to 
carry a higher global burden of rare, genic copy number variants (CNVs) (1.19 fold, P = 
0.012), especially so for loci previously implicated in either ASD and/or intellectual disability 
(1.69 fold, P = 3.4 x 10(-4)). Among the CNVs there were numerous de novo and inherited 
events, sometimes in combination in a given family, implicating many novel ASD genes such 
as SHANK2, SYNGAP1, DLGAP2 and the X-linked DDX53-PTCHD1 locus. We also discovered 
an enrichment of CNVs disrupting functional gene sets involved in cellular proliferation, 
projection and motility, and GTPase/Ras signalling. Our results reveal many new genetic and 
functional targets in ASD that may lead to final connected pathways.</Abstract><Type>C</Type><Progress></Progress><Investigator><Person_ID>548528</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>P</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>548479</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>554093</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Percent_Grant_Dollars>0</Percent_Grant_Dollars></Subproject><Subproject Sub_ID="305418"><Subproject_ID>0048</Subproject_ID><Title>ANALYSIS OF CHEMOGENOMIC INFORMATION IN YEAST</Title><AIDS_Flag>N</AIDS_Flag><Abstract>Present day approaches to uncover gene function often rely on the ability to construct 
gene knockouts. While this gene-by-gene approach is straightforward in organisms with 
facile genetic methods such as yeast and flies, it is difficult in most other organisms. 
Furthermore, gene knockouts only allow analysis of nonessential genes. Fast acting, 
reversible chemical probes are an ideal way to perturb the function of essential genes. The 
primary objective of this proposal is to identify inhibitory chemical probes for all essential 
gene products in yeast using a genome-wide method that allows us to profile the relative 
sensitivity all protein targets in a cell simultaneously. This chemogenomic assay, 
Haplolnsufficiency Profiling (HIP), is based on the observation that lowering the dosage of 
a single gene from two copies to one copy in diploid yeast results in a heterozygote that is 
sensitized to any compound that acts on the product of this gene (Nat Genet. 21,278 
(1999)). In the assay, a complete collection of 5,918 heterozygous deletion strains is 
pooled, grown competitively in the presence of compound and sampled. Molecular bar-
codes incorporated into each strain allow parallel analysis and relative strain fitness to be 
quantitatively assessed by hybridization to oligonucleotide arrays. We validated the assay 
by screening 1,200 compounds with known biological activity. For all FDA therapeutics 
screened, the strain heterozygous for the known target was highly sensitive to drug. 
Recent breakthroughs in assay miniaturization and automation enable high-throughput 
screening of large numbers of compounds. As a result, the assay can now be implemented 
in a combined functional genomics and compound discovery effort. The outcome of this 
effort will be a catalog of chemical probes and their essential gene targets. In addition, 
such genome-wide exploration of biological and chemical space will identify novel, 
&quot;druggable&quot; targets and allow characterization of chemical structures that comprise &quot;drug-
like&quot; compounds. As part of this effort, data will be disseminated to the community via a 
web interface. Cytoscape is being used to visualize and analyze chemogenomic networks 
derived from these experiments.</Abstract><Type>C</Type><Progress></Progress><Investigator><Person_ID>548529</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>P</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>548479</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>554095</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Percent_Grant_Dollars>0</Percent_Grant_Dollars></Subproject><Subproject Sub_ID="305419"><Subproject_ID>0049</Subproject_ID><Title>ANALYZING HSP90 GENETIC INTERACTIONS IN THE YEAST</Title><AIDS_Flag>N</AIDS_Flag><Abstract>Targeting Hsp90 as a Powerful, Broadly Effective Therapeutic Strategy for Diverse Fungal 
Infectious Diseases. We previously established that inhibition of Hsp90 in the leading fungal 
pathogen of humans, Candida albicans, blocks the evolution of resistance to drugs that 
target the cell membrane and renders resistant pathogens responsive to treatment in vitro. 
Our translational work in this area established broad therapeutic potential and was recently 
published in PNAS (Cowen LE et al. 2009. PNAS 106:2818-23). Inhibition of Hsp90 with 
molecules that are well tolerated in humans enhances the efficacy of antifungals in an 
invertebrate model of disease caused by C. albicans and by the most lethal mould, 
Aspergillus fumigatus. Genetic reduction of pathogen Hsp90 enhances the therapeutic 
efficacy of antifungals in a mouse model of disseminated fungal disease. This paves the way 
for the new therapeutics. Our current efforts in this area focus on drug screens to identify 
new molecules with the capacity to abrogate fungal drug resistance. We are using Cytoscape 
to visualize networks of Hsp90 and its targets.</Abstract><Type>C</Type><Progress></Progress><Investigator><Person_ID>548530</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>P</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>548479</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>554096</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Percent_Grant_Dollars>0</Percent_Grant_Dollars></Subproject><Subproject Sub_ID="305420"><Subproject_ID>0050</Subproject_ID><Title>CLINICAL GENOMICS OF HUMAN GENETIC DISEASES</Title><AIDS_Flag>N</AIDS_Flag><Abstract>Discovery of the gene variants that cause or modulate common disease has the potential 
to yield profound medical and socioeconomic benefit. Knowledge of the gene variants 
influencing disease risk, outcome and drug responsiveness will make it increasingly 
possible to tailor or customize an individual’s medical care so as to optimize health 
outcomes. However, despite extraordinary advances in genomic technologies, many 
challenges remain to achieving this so-called “personalized medicine” paradigm. Chief 
among these challenges are the current bottlenecks in: a) defining the majority of the 
gene variants modulating common disease; b) access to analytic methods capable of 
handling the highly complex datasets produced by next generation sequencing-based 
population studies; and c) access to methods and tools that enable medically-relevant 
genomic discoveries to be integrated into clinical care. 

It is the goal of this project to address these challenges through development of an 
integrated portfolio of statistical methods and computational tools that will be created, 
tested and refined using two prototype autoimmune diseases, rheumatoid arthritis and 
primary biliary cirrhosis, as exemplars of chronic diseases for which improved diagnostic 
and therapeutic strategies would have high societal impact. The specific aims of our 
project are to:
1)	Identify the major gene variants modulating two prototype autoimmune diseases by 
targeted and whole exome sequencing;
2)	Develop, apply and disseminate biometric methods to expedite use of 
exome/genome-scale datasets for defining and clinically applying disease risk/outcome-
modulating variants; and   
3)	Develop, apply and disseminate bioinformatics tools for incorporating disease-
relevant genomic knowledge into clinical practice.

regenerative and developmental cues in multicellular organisms. Despite the importance of 
intercellular networks in stem cell biology, their rules, structure and molecular components 
are poorly understood. Herein, we describe the structure and dynamics of intercellular and 
intracellular networks in a stem cell derived, hierarchically organized tissue using 
experimental and theoretical analyses of cultured human umbilical cord blood progenitors. By 
integrating high-throughput molecular profiling, database and literature mining, mechanistic 
modeling, and cell culture experiments, we show that secreted factor-mediated intercellular 
communication networks regulate blood stem cell fate decisions. In particular, self-renewal is 
modulated by a coupled positive-negative intercellular feedback circuit composed of 
megakaryocyte-derived stimulatory growth factors (VEGF, PDGF, EGF, and serotonin) versus 
monocyte-derived inhibitory factors (CCL3, CCL4, CXCL10, TGFB2, and TNFSF9). We 
reconstruct a stem cell intracellular network, and identify PI3K, Raf, Akt, and PLC as 
functionally distinct signal integration nodes, linking extracellular, and intracellular signaling. 
This represents the first systematic characterization of how stem cell fate decisions are 
regulated non-autonomously through lineage-specific interactions with differentiated 
progeny.</Abstract><Type>C</Type><Progress></Progress><Investigator><Person_ID>548532</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>P</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>548479</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Publication_ID>419638</Publication_ID>

function of gene products and the mechanisms of the cellular processes in which they are 
involved. An important first step in this endeavor is to derive the circuitry of the cellular 
systems: the networks of physical, biochemical and regulatory interactions, as well as the 
information processing (signal transduction) pathways that occur in cells. Large efforts are 
therefore devoted world-wide to collecting genome scale data on these interactions and 
pathways, using experimental methods, bioinformatics inference procedures, and text 
mining algorithms. As a result, impressive bodies of valuable but noisy data are being 
produced. But consolidating and validating these data, and more importantly, deriving 
meaningful biological information from them poses major challenges. Currently we are 
developing a workbench for displaying and analyzing metabolic and other types of networks 
using Cytoscape. These include efficient means for interactively mapping onto these 
networks information on protein sequences, domains and 3D structures, as well as data on 
drug targets, and genes associated with human diseases. Presently, we use such mappings

cancers retain devastating mortality rates. To improve cancer treatment, we need to 
discover biomarkers for early cancer detection and for planning optimal treatment, and we 
need new therapeutic approaches for targeting metastatic disease.
This will be achieved by identifying and characterizing prognostic/predictive genes (cancer 
targets), which will improve diagnosis and treatment planning. Systematic 
characterization of gene products, their interactions and function will enable identification 
of new drug targets and combination therapies. Many biological assays have been used to 
characterize protein function and interactions, and to link these to cancer. Due to assay 
biases, thousands of proteins and their interactions remain uncharacterized—30-40% of 
cancer targets have no protein interaction data and cannot be used in integrative 
analyses.
To accelerate and optimize the process of functionally characterizing relevant proteins, we 
will apply computational biology and identify the most important putative cancer targets, 
and provide their predicted function and optimal biological assay to focus functional 
studies. The Cancer Gene Encylopedia (CGEP) project will initially integrate and expand 
seven key existing systems that we have developed here in Ontario: CDIP (Cancer Data 
Integration Portal) a molecular cancer profile database, GeneMANIA for gene function 
prediction, I2D (Interologous Interaction Database) for protein interactions, Reactome for 
expert pathway curation, Pathway Commons for pathway annotation, and Cytoscape and 
NAViGaTOR for cancer network integration, visualization and analysis. This will enable 
rational identification of the most relevant cancer protein interactions, verification using 
text mining and human curation from PubMed, prediction of the most suitable bioassays 
for interaction validation, gene/protein function characterization, and relevant protein 
structure target identification.
CGEP integrates an international team with expertise in protein interaction curation at the 
European Bioinformatics Institute, gene annotation in the GeneCards database (Israel), 
protein structure characterization in PSI-Nature Structural Genomics Knowledgebase, 
expert pathway curation/annotation at Reactome and Pathway Commons, public pathway 
annotation in WikiPathways, and leading basic/translational researchers to enable 
selecting best approaches for validating cancer targets, their relevant protein 
interactions/pathways.
This visionary proposal will transform cancer research by providing relevant 
interaction/pathway data, leading to comprehensive characterization of clinically useful 
prognostic/predictive signatures that will improve cancer diagnosis and treatment 
planning. In turn, this Ontario-led and internationally integrated cancer resource will lead 
to improved treatments by identifying and developing new drug targets, and designing 
combination therapies. This globally directed effort will enable Ontario to participate in the 
international IMEx, Reactome and ENFIN consortia. Ontario will fill the current gap of 
expert curation of cancer interactions and pathways and provide leadership in 
computationally-driven identification of novel cancer targets, their interactions and 
pathways. CGEP findings will accelerate novel treatments and create commercialization 
possibilities. Moreover, this project provides opportunities to establish a unique training 
environment and prepare critically needed highly qualified personnel who will work on the 
forefront of cancer genomics and translational research in Ontario’s R&amp;D sectors in the 
future.

We recently participated in a project led by the Laboratory of 
Cornelis Murre (UCSD) focused on identifying the regulatory network underlying B-cell 
differentiation. Integrative analysis of genome-wide gene expression, TF-DNA binding (ChIP-
seq) and histone methylation profiles uncovered a global network of over 2000 putative 
targets regulated by three key transcription factors (E2A, EBF1 and Foxo1) which act in a 
combinatorial, cell-state-specific fashion12. This study made extensive use of Cytoscape for 
data integration, visualization, as well as functional enrichment analysis.
We have shown that E2A and EBF1, as well as E2A and Foxo1, were wired together by a 
vast spectrum of cis-regulatory sequences. These associations were dynamic during 
developmental progression. Occupancy by the E2A isoform E47 directly resulted in greater 
abundance, as well as a pattern of monomethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4) across 
putative enhancer regions. Finally, we divided the pro-B cell epigenome into clusters of loci 
with occupancy by E2A, EBF and Foxo1. From this analysis we constructed a global network 
consisting of transcriptional regulators, signaling and survival factors that we propose 
orchestrates B cell fate.</Abstract><Type>C</Type><Progress></Progress><Investigator><Person_ID>548522</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>P</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>548514</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>453037</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Percent_Grant_Dollars>0</Percent_Grant_Dollars></Subproject><Subproject Sub_ID="305852"><Subproject_ID>0056</Subproject_ID><Title>GENETIC ANALYSIS OF GLAUCOMA AND AGE-RELATED MACULAR

genome-wide genetic data has driven the investigation of genetic associations with human 
diseases. Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and Glaucoma are highly heritable ocular 
diseases with genetic roots that are not fully understood. Collecting genetic data is only the 
first step, as the computational tools and algorithms for analyzing it are still a matter of 
considerable research. We are working to collect whole-exome genetic information from 
several hundreds of patients, diagnosed with AMD, Glaucoma, or Control, to better 
understand ocular disease. We are also employing novel algorithms involving gene network 
and pathway information to improve the power and the ability to meaningfully interpret the 
genetic data.</Abstract><Type>C</Type><Progress></Progress><Investigator><Person_ID>548520</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>P</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>453037</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>548511</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Percent_Grant_Dollars>0</Percent_Grant_Dollars></Subproject><Subproject Sub_ID="305853"><Subproject_ID>0057</Subproject_ID><Title>PINGO: A CYTOSCAPE PLUGIN TO FIND CANDIDATE GENES</Title><AIDS_Flag>N</AIDS_Flag><Abstract>PiNGO is a tool to screen biological networks for candidate genes, i.e. genes predicted to be

biologists worldwide. After generating a set of potential interactions, biologists face the 
problem of highlighting the ones that are novel and collecting evidence with respect to 
literature and annotation. This task can be as tedious as searching for every predicted 
interaction in several interaction data repositories, or manually screening the scientific 
literature. To facilitate the task of evidence mining and novelty assessment of protein-
protein interactions, we have developed a Cytoscape plugin that automatically mines 
publication references, database references, interaction detection method descriptions and 
pathway annotation for a user-supplied network of interactions. The basis for the annotation 
is ConsensusPathDB-a meta-database that integrates numerous protein-protein, signaling, 
metabolic and gene regulatory interaction repositories for currently three species: Homo 
sapiens, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Mus musculus.

The ConsensusPathDB plugin for Cytoscape (version 2.7.0 or later) can be installed within 
Cytoscape on a major operating system (Windows, Mac OS, Unix/Linux) with Sun Java 1.5 
or later installed through Cytoscape&apos;s Plugin manager (category &apos;Network and Attribute I/O&apos;). 
The plugin is freely available for download on the ConsensusPathDB web site 
(http://cpdb.molgen.mpg.de).</Abstract><Type>C</Type><Progress></Progress><Investigator><Person_ID>554311</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>P</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>453037</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>548486</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>554312</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Publication_ID>419636</Publication_ID><Publication_ID>419643</Publication_ID><Percent_Grant_Dollars>0</Percent_Grant_Dollars></Subproject><Subproject Sub_ID="305855"><Subproject_ID>0059</Subproject_ID><Title>A HUMAN MAP KINASE INTERACTOME</Title><AIDS_Flag>N</AIDS_Flag><Abstract>Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways form the backbone of signal transduction 
in the mammalian cell. Here we applied a systematic experimental and computational 
approach to map 2,269 interactions between human MAPK-related proteins and other 
cellular machinery and to assemble these data into functional modules. Multiple lines of 
evidence including conservation with yeast supported a core network of 641 interactions. 
Using small interfering RNA knockdowns, we observed that approximately one-third of MAPK-
interacting proteins modulated MAPK-mediated signaling. We uncovered the Na-H exchanger 
NHE1 as a potential MAPK scaffold, found links between HSP90 chaperones and MAPK 
pathways and identified MUC12 as the human analog to the yeast signaling mucin Msb2. 
This study makes available a large resource of MAPK interactions and clone libraries, and it 
illustrates a methodology for probing signaling networks based on functional refinement of 
experimentally derived protein-interaction maps.</Abstract><Type>C</Type><Progress></Progress><Investigator><Person_ID>554313</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>P</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>554314</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>548515</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>453037</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Publication_ID>419627</Publication_ID>

analysis and modeling of the biological networks. VisANT allows visual analysis and 
exploratory navigation of the interactions between biomolecules (inclusive relationships) for 
110+ organisms, both computational and experimental. The system is automatically 
synchronized with other databases such as MINT, BioGrid and Entrez Gene for the 
corresponding data. VisANT implements an advanced graph type—metagraph, developed in 
our Lab to integrate inclusive or partially inclusive relationships between information at 
different abstraction scales (e.g., the hierarchy of Gene Ontology, or network modules) and 
the adjacent relationships between biomolecules into one single network. Such visualization 
technology is often referred to multi-scale visualization because information at different 
abstraction scales is presented in one network. Using this technology VisANT integrates 
hierarchy of Gene Ontology with the interaction network and developed two network-based 
enrichment algorithms to facilitate the combined analysis of biological high-throughput data 
(e.g. expression data) in the context of both biomolecular networks and a solid functional 
classification system of gene products. Furthermore, cluster groups or other motifs of the 
network can be re-examined and validated by the identification of statistically enriched GO 
annotations among the affected genes/proteins. </Abstract><Type>C</Type><Progress></Progress><Investigator><Person_ID>557319</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>P</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>453037</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Investigator><Person_ID>548482</Person_ID><Investigator_Type>C</Investigator_Type></Investigator><Publication_ID>435781</Publication_ID>
