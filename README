1. Edit scrape.php and enter the group name (e.g., cytoscape-helpdesk); then save and quit
2. Run by typing command: 
php scrape.php > scrape.xml
3. Then run our perl scripts on the xml to parse out various stats:
perl GoogleGroups_XML_parser-v2.pl scrape.xml

Note: the output of the per parser is a "-stats.txt" file which can be imported into Excel to generate charts.
